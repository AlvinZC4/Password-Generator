# Password-Generator

This is a webpage that lets the user generate a random password based on criteria entered by the user.

The random password generator will ask the user how many characters he/she would like their password to be (they must pick between 8 and 128 characters).  The user is then asked if they would like their password to include lowercase, uppercase, numerical, and special characters.  Once the user has selected the criteria for the password he/she can click on the "Generate Password" button and their randomly generated password will appear on the page.

It should be noted that if the user trys to set a password length less than 8 characters or more than 128 characters then they will be prompted again to select a valid character length for their password.  The user also must select at least one character type to include in their password; if they attempt to select none then they will receive an alert letting them know that they must select at least one character type and then they will be prompted again to choose which characters to include in their randomly generated password.
